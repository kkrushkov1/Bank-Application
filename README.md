## Description


Read a .csv file of names, social security numbers, account type and initial deposit.
Use a proper data structure to hold all these accounts.

Both savings and checking accounts share the following properties:
- deposit()
- withdraw()
- transfer()
- showInfo()

Savings Accounts holders are given Safety Deposit Box, identified by a 3-digit number and accessed with a 4-digit code.
Checking Account holders are assigned a Debit Card with a 12-digit number and 4-digit PIN.
Both Accounts will use an interface that determines the base interest rate.
- Savings accounts will use .25 points less than the base rate.
- Checking accounts will use 15% of the base rate.

The showInfo() method should reveal relevant account information as well as information specific to the Checking account or Savings account.
